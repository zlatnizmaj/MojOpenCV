The proposed import solution did not work for me. I had exactly this problem with OpenCV 4.2.0 compiled from sources, installed in my Conda environment and PyCharm 2020.1.

I solved this way:

Select project interpreter
Click on the settings button next to it and then clicking on the Show paths for selected interpreter
added the directory containing the cv2 library (in my case in the Conda Python library path - e.g. miniconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/cv2/python-3.7). In general check the site-packages/cv2/python-X.X directory)
