# Moving objects edge detection
"""
What if we donâ€™t care about the tables and walls in the background?
The way this tutorial will present you to extract moving objects contours is the background subtraction.
The next example presents the createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2 function of OpenCV.
It extracts the moving parts of the images (middle image below).
Pay attention to the morphologyEx function:
It dilates the moving objects
Then shrinks them back.
The moving part of the image is then used as a mask.
It crops the edges computed with canny, keeping only the moving part.

# Read the video

    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if ret == True:
        gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
